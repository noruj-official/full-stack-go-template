We accept vulnerability reports via email and GitHub Security Advisories.

### Reporting via Email

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and strive to send you regular updates about our progress. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will credit you after it has been patched and released.

### Reporting via GitHub

If you prefer, you can report a vulnerability through [GitHub's private reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) if enabled on this repository.

## Disclosure Policy

When the team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1.  **Confirm the issue and determine the affected versions.**
2.  **Audit code to find any similar potential problems.**
3.  **Prepare fixes for all currently supported versions.** These fixes will be released as fast as possible.

We ask that you do not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a chance to fix it.
